### High Resolution CPU Image

This sample demonstrates high resolution CPU image capture on iOS 16 and newer. Check the [High Resolution CPU Image](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arkit@6.0/manual/arkit-camera.html#high-resolution-cpu-image) package documentation to learn more about this feature.

### Camera Exposure

This sample shows how to lock the device camera and set the camera exposure mode, duration, and ISO. Refer to [CameraExposureController.cs](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples/blob/main/Assets/Scenes/ARKit/CameraExposure/CameraExposureController.cs) for example code.

This sample requires iOS 16 or newer and a device with an ultra-wide camera.

### Camera White Balance

This sample shows how to lock the device camera and set the camera white balance mode and gains. Refer to [CameraWhiteBalanceController.cs](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples/blob/main/Assets/Scenes/ARKit/CameraWhiteBalance/CameraWhiteBalanceController.cs) for example code.

This sample requires iOS 16 or newer and a device with an ultra-wide camera.

### Camera Focus

This sample shows how to lock the device camera and set the camera focus mode and lens position. Refer to [CameraFocusController.cs](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples/blob/main/Assets/Scenes/ARKit/CameraFocus/CameraFocusController.cs) for example code.

This sample requires iOS 16 or newer and a device with an ultra-wide camera.

## ARCore Session Recording

This sample demonstrates the session recording and playback functionality available in ARCore. This feature allows you to record the sensor and camera telemetry during a live session, and then reply it at later time. When replayed, ARCore runs on the target device using the recorded telemetry rather than live data. Refer to [ARCoreSessionRecorder.cs](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples/blob/main/Assets/Scripts/Runtime/ARCore/ARCoreSessionRecorder.cs) for example code.
